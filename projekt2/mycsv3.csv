One festival is primarily white, the other is predominantly black. While bikers of both colors enjoy both festivals; the city, community and state view these two festivals vastly different creating a divide among the participants, business owners and residents. Against the backdrop of the historical relevance of the area's segregated past, this documentary explores the opposing viewpoints on segregation and integration, mutual love of motorcycle culture, and racial tensions that reach a boiling point every spring in this southern beach mecca.	0.6	/3kNhkqcp74Zi3BeGvre35H9HK4F.jpg	[]	[]	2018-06-05	0	60	[]	Released		Black Beach White Beach	False	0.0	0

After the days, weeks and months that followed the Sewol tragedy, the country became undone, untrusting and more divided than we have ever seen in its history. ""After the Sewol"" explores the changing faces of this nation through the eyes of two British film makers. They talk with relatives of the victims, rescue divers and activists about their struggles and battles since this tragic accident happened and embark upon a journey to uncover how this accident came about, looking deep into Korean history about why no action was taken to prevent it in the first place. This journey takes them all over Korea, meeting an older generation struggling to create a safer place for their children to live in and a young vibrant generation fighting for a corrupt free society.But, all of them searching for one thing, the truth about why the Sewol victims died."	0.6	/8vPGKtY7iYBkiz0zXSmKUMG1MQ3.jpg	[]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'KR', 'name': 'South Korea'}]	2017-01-06	0	93	[{'iso_639_1': 'ko', 'name': '한국어/조선말'}]	Released		After the Sewol	False	0.0	0
